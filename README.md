# pyenv-win-installer

An easy install script for pyenv on windows.

## Usage

First, you will need to allow PowerShell to run this script. This is a security feature built into Windows and I encourage you to inspect the script at your lesire to ensure everything is as you expect.

To allow powershell to run this script, first download and unzip this project. Then, right-click on `install.ps1` in Windows Explorer and select Properties in the context menu. From there, select the Unblock button.

After that process is complete, simply right-click on `install.ps1` and select "Run with PowerShell" in the context menu. Python and PyEnv will automatically be installed.

You may also run this script by using PowerShell to navigate to this directory and running `.\install.ps1`.
